                <li>2019 - NCS (National Citizenship Service) - NCS is an experience you can do between the ages of 16-17 and allows you to learn skills for the working world and takes you out of your comfort zone. On the first week you do activities such as canoeing, bushcraft, high ropes, etc. The second week is aimed at working in the real world with workshops such as public speaking, managing money, what itâ€™s like to stay at university dorms, etc. And the last part of the challenge is volunteering with a local partner. For me this was a care home for the elderly for which we hosted a carnival themed party to help them feel less isolated.</li>
                <li>2017 - Deloitte: Interview workshop - My former school has a partnership with Deloitte meaning that they arrange activity days, one being a workshop preparing us for interviews to come throughout our lives. They taught us about key tips to use when in interviews such as keeping eye contact, Speaking clearly, paying attention to what the interviewer is saying, etc.</li>
                <li>2016 - Deloitte: Working in the city with Societe Generale - As said above, my previous school has a partnership with Deloitte so another event that I attended was a workshop on what itâ€™s like to work in Central London. This event was hosted by Societe Generale and they took us through talks with people who work at the bank and what its like to work there.</li>
